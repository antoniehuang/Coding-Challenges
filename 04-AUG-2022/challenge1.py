'''
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.
What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples: 
input --> output

123 --> "123"
999 --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

'''
def number_to_string(num):
    return str(num)
    # Return a string of the number here!
    
# Python doesn't have a toString method, instead we use str() to type cast the object we want to convert to string.
